        <p1> Ethiopian lion's, also known as Addis Ababa lion or Abyssinian lion, are known for their distinctive dark mane  
            and is slightly smaller than traditional african Lions. They are every rare and it is thought that there are 
            less then 100 lions alived in the world. 
      
            Ethiopian lions have darker manes and are much smaller than the other lion subspecies. This could be a reason why they get captured
            so easily.
